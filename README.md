Game Description
---------------------------
We are employing computer vision to recognize specific hand movements, which correspond to the birds' jumps in the flappy-bird game.
Below is the identified image of the hand. The movement captured in this image's frames helps identify the specific gestures needed to play the game.

How to play
---------------------------
1. The primary rule of Flappy Bird is to navigate the bird through obstacles without touching them or the ground.

2. We maneuver the bird by making a specific hand gesture â€”> Touching the tips of the index and thumb fingers to form an "O" shape.

3. Ensure adequate lighting conditions before playing to ensure a seamless gameplay experience.

Setup (as tested on Windows)
---------------------------

1. Install Python 3 from [here](https://www.python.org/download/releases/) 

2. Run `make init` (this will install pip packages, use virtualenv or something similar if you don't want to install globally)

3. Use this code to install the required libraries to play `pip install pygame opencv-python-headless mediapipe numpy` .

4. Allow the camera permissions to play.

5. Run `main.py` to play the game. 

6. Use <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> key to play and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the game.

7. To play the game in the browser, you can optionally use `make web` command (pygbag).
