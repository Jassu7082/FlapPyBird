2. Run `make init` (this will install pip packages, use virtualenv or something similar if you don't want to install globally)

3. Use this code to install the required libraries to play `pip install pygame opencv-python-headless mediapipe numpy` .

4. Allow the camera permissions to play.

5. Run `main.py` to play the game. 

6. Use <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> key to play and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the game.
